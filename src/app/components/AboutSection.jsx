						Hi, I'm Rishabh Chandrode from Khandwa, MP. I've earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from UIT RGPV, Bhopal, and have been passionate about software development ever since. I've had the opportunity to work as a software developer engineer, where I gained hands-on experience building scalable and efficient applications across various tech stacks. Whether it's frontend, backend, or cloud, I enjoy the entire process of turning ideas into real, working software.
						<br />
						<br />
						I'm always eager to learn new technologies and solve complex problems, especially when they involve making life easier through automation or innovative solutions. When I'm not busy writing code, you'll often find me strumming my guitar or diving deep into my music playlistâ€”it's my way of balancing logic with creativity.
						<br />
						<br />
						I'm constantly exploring new challenges and opportunities in the tech world, so if you're here to learn more about what I do or collaborate on something exciting, feel free to reach out!
